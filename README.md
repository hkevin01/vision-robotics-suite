A Python codebase demonstrating industrial automation concepts through simulated vision systems and quality control modules.

## 🎯 What's Actually Here

This repository contains Python modules that simulate industrial automation workflows:

- **Vision System Architecture**: Base classes and interfaces for vision systems
- **Simulated Inspection Modules**: Paint inspection, body-in-white, timing chain verification, battery pack QC
- **Development Environment**: Docker containers with Python, Node.js, Go, Rust toolchains
- **Code Quality Tools**: Black, flake8, mypy, pytest with CI/CD workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)
- Git

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vision-robotics-suite
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### Docker Development Environment

```bash
# Start development containers with full toolchain
make dev-start

# Enter development shell
make dev-shell
```

## 🔧 Core Technologies

### Machine Vision Systems

- HALCON (conceptual integration stubs)
- Cognex VisionPro (integration scaffolding)
- OpenCV, 3D point cloud handling

### Robotics

- FANUC (force feedback integration examples)
- Yaskawa & ABB (multi-robot coordination scaffolds)
- Universal Robots (collaborative safety zone logic)

### Controls & Data

- PLC communication placeholders
- Quality & SPC analysis modules
- Monitoring / logging integration points

## 💡 Example (Abbreviated)

```python
from src.vision_systems.automotive_paint_inspection import AutomotivePaintInspector, InspectionParameters

params = InspectionParameters()
inspector = AutomotivePaintInspector(params)
result = inspector.inspect_paint_surface("sample.jpg")
print(result.get("defects_detected"))
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
poetry run pytest                # Run tests
poetry run black src tests       # Format
poetry run flake8 src tests      # Lint
poetry run mypy src              # Type check
```

## 📚 Documentation

Currently only high-level planning exists:

- `docs/project_plan.md` – roadmap / planning notes

(Additional architecture and API docs can be added incrementally as modules mature.)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or submit a pull request with:

- Clear problem statement
- Minimal reproducible example (if bug)
- Focused, scoped changes

## 📄 License

## 📊 Status & Scope

This repository contains illustrative, prototype-level modules. Some integrations (HALCON, Cognex, proprietary robot SDKs) are represented with stubs or mock implementations for demonstration and cannot run production workflows without vendor SDKs.

## 🧩 Removed Placeholder Content

Removed previous placeholder email, generic support inbox, and links to non‑existent docs to keep the README factual and lean.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Open source ecosystem and industrial automation community for tooling and patterns.

Focused, realistic, and incrementally extensible.
